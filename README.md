Harvard CS 109 - Data Science - Fall 2013
=========================================

Harvard was nice enought to put all content of the CS 109 class available online.

I did not take this class but I was able to follow it along and do the homeworks.

This repo contains all content from Fall 2013 and my personal solution to the homeworks.
